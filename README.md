# Sparsistent Model Discovery
#### In this repo, we share the code, data and results of the paper
###
### (1) Randomised Adaptive Lasso:
#### we propose and implement a randomized adaptive Lasso with stability selection and error control
#### see 'pure_sparse_regression_based/pdeX/sparsity_estimators.py'
###
### (2) ... within DeepMod
#### we implement the latter sparsity estimator in DeepMod
#### see 'deep_learning_based' folder which contains notebooks with examples
#### for example the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation example can be reproduced by running 'xKS50.ipynb'
#### 
#### Requirements: conda and pip requirements are shared (see .txt files)
